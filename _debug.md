## Bed 20 - Add email address for responsible person
- Just work through the application and find out more about -- it.
- Issue described by email as Add email address for responsible person - also to be reflected on PDF
- Try to generate said PDF.
- interesting --> I need to figure out the following:
--> I think need to add an email field for responsoible person as shown on this url http://localhost:3000/garfile/printmanifest
--> what is more, this will need to be available on another part of the site.
--> I need to figure out if this can just be added as a field or if more information is needed.
--> further more, where is this information being sent to and why.
--> end to end tests need to be run locally.
